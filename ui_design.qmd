# UI/UX Design w/ user-centered co-design
User-centered user-inteface (UI) and user-experience (UX) co-design is a conceptual framework for collecting, organizing, and developing to meet user needs.

The process can be summarized as:

1. collect user stories
2. create use case from the user stories
3. solve the user story


### user story collection
A "user story" can be represented by a statement in the following form:

```
"As a ___ I want ___ so that ___."
```

Early in the development of project ideas, collecting use-cases in this form will help identify the outcomes that are most important for your userbase.


### select use case
Developing a user story can be an important part of explicitly defining the needs and wants of your target users.
Once a set of use cases have been collected, a user story can be created that will satisfy multiple use cases.
A good user story is generic enough to cover many use cases but specific enough to be clearly resolved.

A use case is a task or workflow for which your product is used.

Examples:
* "check a region of interest for recent anomalous temperatures"
* "get an email alert when a major temperature anomaly is detected"
* "see where the most biologically diverse areas are"

### iterative design
The aim of an iterative design process is to involve users as the features of a product are built piece-by-piece.


### speak aloud protocol
"Speak aloud protocol" is a way of collecting user feedback that encourages a user of the product to speak their thoughts aloud when using the product.
The facilitator should try to minimize guidance or influence on the user and encourage free-form expression from the user.
This protocol can be particularly useful for identifying the "pain points" in a user workflow, wherein a user gets stuck wondering how to move to the next step of their task.

## Definitions:

* `co-design` : Designing with equal contribution from stakeholders at *every* step of development
* `user story` : As a ___ I want ___ so that ___.
* `use case` : Generalized summary of user stories in context of the application.
* `iterative design` : Repeating pattern of 1) design next iteration 2) user evaluation 
* `minimum viable product` : First design iteration with minimal features to be useful.
* `speak aloud protocol` : Method for user evaluation that aims to minimize evaluator impact.
